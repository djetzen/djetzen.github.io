Here is a list of books, which I have read over the past couple of years. The list starts in 2016, as this was the first time where I was taking notes on which book I read at which time and how long it did take me to finish it.

If I do not find good summaries for the book I read (e.g. Wikipedia), then I take notes on my own, where I sum up the plot and the main characters. I am not limited on a particular topic, but most of the time it is fiction I read and only seldomly some non-fiction.
