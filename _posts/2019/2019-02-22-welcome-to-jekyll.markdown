I always wanted to do a blog about the stuff which I come across the whole day and want to share with others. 
In this blog I will most likely cover different topics:
 - books I read
 - media I consume (movies, TV series, games)
 - programming stuff I stumble across

 At the moment I am not sure, whether I will write the posts in german or english, but lets see.

 More posts will follow in a very unfrequent way.
