After a long time without having an idea what to write, it came to my mind to do a recap of which actions I took this year to increase at least a little bit my privacy. This year was the first year, where I consequently had a look at it, so therefore there are a lot of low hanging fruits.

## General stuff
- Moved my emailadress to [posteo] (https://www.posteo.de)
- Moved away from uploading all pictures to the managed cloud and rather upload it to my nextcloud hosted on my raspberry pi
- Host my contacts also on the nextcloud
- started using an alternative search engine to google, where privacy is first
- looked for open source alternatives for most of the programs and also for the development tools I use everyday.
- Stopped wearing my fitbit
- deleted my last.fm account
- mostly got rid of music streaming services (still kept them for convenience to be honest)
- consequently installed browsers with anti-fingerprinting and adblockers

## Phone
- Got rid of google on my private phone by installing a ROM with hardended and pure Android Open Source Project. See [here.](https://www.djetzen.de/privacy/tech/2019/09/17/flashing-my-pixel.html)
- installed a keyboard and podcatcher which does not track me
- Deleted Instagram and Facebook accounts
- Moved many conversations to [Signal](https://signal.org/).

## ToDo in 2020
- Move nearly all the conversations to Signal or other messengers which are encrypted and do not track their users.
- Have a look which other services I use and do no longer need and consequently delete it. Or re-evaluate if I should really use them, if they are problematic.
- clean up the last parts in the managed cloud, which I still use.
