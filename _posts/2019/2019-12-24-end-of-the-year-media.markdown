This is an unordered list of all the media I enjoyed this year.
## Book
I read a lot of books throughout this year, the most in a year, since I track them. The books I liked this year are (in no specific order):
- Fernando Aramburu - Patria
- Olga Grjasnowa - Gott ist nicht schüchtern
- Martin Sonneborn - Herr Sonneborn geht nach Brüssel: Abenteuer im Europaparlament
- Haruki Murakami - Mister Aufziehvogel
- Daniel Kahneman - Schnelles Denken, langsames Denken
## Games
Some games I really liked this year are Death Stranding, What remains of Edith Finch, God of War, Yoshis Crafted World, Cuphead, Little Nightmares, Sekiro (even though I did not beat it) and Octopath Traveler. The most interesting game for me for sure is Death Stranding, as I am a huge fan of the Metal Gear series and like most of the games Hideo Kojima did.
## Music
As I mainly listen to Rock, it is not surprising that the most listend albums of the year are:
- Tool - Fear Inoculum
- Rammstein - Rammstein
## Podcast
This year was the first year, where I listened to a lot of podcasts. Maybe I will do a separate post on all the podcasts I listen to, but here are some highlights:
- [Alles geagt?](https://www.zeit.de/serie/alles-gesagt) from Zeit Online. - [Deutschlandfunk Hintergrund](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/podcast-hintergrund.725.de.podcast.xml)
- [Eine Stunde History](https://www.deutschlandfunknova.de/podcasts/download/eine-stunde-history).
## YouTube videos
The links to the videos are posted on [invidio](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious) for privacy reasons. Two videos I really enjoyed are these talks about privacy, even if they are not from this year:
- [35C3 - Archäologische Studien im Datenmüll ](https://invidio.us/watch?v=lbN6R6MubSI)
- [SpiegelMining – Reverse Engineering von Spiegel-Online (33c3)](https://invidio.us/watch?v=-YpwsdRKt8Q)

I also had a lot of fun with some videos from GameTwo:
- [Unspielbar](https://invidio.us/watch?v=2tGigdrn8hA)
- [SciFi-Klischees](https://invidio.us/watch?v=W4q4uhPxQxQ)
